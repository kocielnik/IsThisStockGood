Determining effective management is one of the more difficult tasks. Ideally we
want the management to be 'driven' and 'owner-oriented'. In other words, we want
them to be on the same team as the investors. They should have their priorities
of growing the company long-term in the same way investors want to invest
long-term. This can usually be inferred by their compensation strategy. If they
take a large salary and/or have large compensation from stock options, then this
might be a bad sign that they have misaligned incentives. A good way to dig into
this is looking at the insider trading activity of the company. Also read up
on the 10-K (annual reports) from the company, which are required by the SEC and
read up on the background of the CEO to see if they have a proven track record.
Lastly, the management should be effective at managing debt. Ideally the company
should have no more than 3-times as much debt as their free cash flow, otherwise
interest rates can become a problem and accumulating more debt becomes risky.
