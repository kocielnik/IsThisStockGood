In Phil Town's 'Payback Time', he describes a method for projecting the number of years required
for the business's earnings (i.e. net income) to justify the current share price, factoring in
its expected growth rate. According to Phil Town, the goal is for a payback time less than 8 years,
which reflects roughly what private equity investments aim for (9% rate of return per year). A
payback time less than 6 is considered very good. A payback time of 8 years or less, is solid.
