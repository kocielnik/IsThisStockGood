A paraphrased excerpt from chapter 15 in Rule #1 Investing titled 'Prepare for
Your First Rule #1 Purchase': A good rule of thumb is to find a business that
trades more than 500,000 shares a day. (If the share price is < $1, make it
1,000,000 shares per day.) Additionally make sure that you own less than 1% of
the total dollar amount of trades in a given day. -- These two rules will help
ensure that you can get in/out of the stock without affecting the price and
can do so at a moment's notice.
