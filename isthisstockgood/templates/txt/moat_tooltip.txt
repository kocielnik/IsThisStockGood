In order to make a confident investment, the goal is to buy strong business with
good track records and a durable competitive advantage (i.e. a 'moat' -- like
one that surrounds a castle). In order to determine this, we look at 5 key
growth rates (listed in order of importance): Return on Invested Capital (ROIC),
Equity (also called Book Value Per Share or BVPS), Earnings Per Share (EPS),
Sales/Revenue, Free Cash Flow. Ideally you want to see each of these values
being greater than 10% for the past 10 years. And they should be increasing
from year to year. Seeing either of these trends is a good sign that the company
is an industry leader with a strong moat. For more information, read the
following chapters from Rule #1 Investing: chapter 4 'Identify a Moat', chapter
5 'The Big Five Numbers', and chapter 6 'Calculating the Big Five'.
