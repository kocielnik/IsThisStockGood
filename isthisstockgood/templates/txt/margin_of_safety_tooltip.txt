Always make sure to buy with a large margin of safety (recommended = 50%). This
means that once you calculate a fair value for the stock today (i.e. sticker
price), buy it for half of that. This helps protect against any unknown
information or mistakes in the calculations. So first calculate the estimated
sticker price to buy the stock at a fair value, which is done as a conservative
calculation based on a few key factors such as historical growth, projected
future growth, and earnings-per-share. Then take this fair value and divide
it in half to get the price to buy at with a 50% margin of safety. For more
information, read the following chapters from Rule #1 Investing: chapter 8
'Demand a Margin of Safety' and chapter 9 'Calculate the Sticker Price'.
